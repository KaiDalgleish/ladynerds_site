<p>About

Welcome to Lady Nerds! We are a professional network of over two hundred women 
in technology in the Bay Area and beyond. Our members are alumnae of the Hackbright 
Academy fellowship in software engineering, although Lady Nerds as an organization is 
not affiliated with Hackbright.

Our mission is to empower women in technology through continued career development, 
enriching connections, and responsible representation.  We strive to be a community-driven 
support system for those with the shared experience of completing Hackbright or otherwise 
equivalent program.
