# ladynerds_site

Ladynerds are an organization comprised of women who graduated from the Hackbright Academy coding bootcamp.  There are roughly 300 of us working in a variety of roles within the tech industry, primarily in San Francisco, but in other locations as well. 

This CRUD webapp is a collective project that will have the following features as part of the MVP:

- Display all users and skills 
- Google Cal integration:   https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/quickstart/python#prerequisites
- Good UI


We've chosen to use the old terminal color scheme of green on a black background.  

The green color hex value: #00ff00
The terminal font is in google fonts: https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/VT323

Nice to haves:
- Slack integration 
- Twitter feed display 

Currently has:
- Login /logout 
- About page url 
- Profile page
